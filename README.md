# Portfolio
Projects I've created for a my portfolio. 


Here are some examples of my work. I'd love a job as a Data Analyst or Data Scinetist. Visualization is my forte, but I love learning things from collected data. Growing up a sci-fi nerd has helped me appreciate my machine learning journey as well. Knowing that things they only dreamed of on the televison can be a reality, and I can help make that happen is really fueling my desire to keep progressing in the field of machine learning and AI.

While those dreams are a way off, I am fully ready to take on any challenge you throw my way. From web scraping and cleaning data to training models and creatinng beautiful visualizations.
